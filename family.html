<i> The meaning of family is really big for me. Family is everythings to me and i don't know if i don't have them in this world. We always support each other, loving each other, respect each other and also trust each other. My parents is very strict about respectful among each siblings. They want we to respect each other because respect is really important for we to keep loving each other. The love between these families will never break, but it will be a distance if they do not respect each other. So my last word is we always have to respect each other in the family and still keep in touch even though we busy at work because family is always number one for us.</i>
